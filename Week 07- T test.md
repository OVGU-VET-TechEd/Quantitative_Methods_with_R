# Objectives of the Lecture

- Understand different group comparison techniques  
- Learn when to apply each method  
- Apply methods using R  
- Interpret results meaningfully  

# Group Comparison

Group comparison in quantitative research refers to the statistical methods used to compare differences between groups in terms of their central tendencies (e.g., means, medians), variability or other statistical properties. It helps researchers determine whether the observed differences between groups are statistically significant or likely due to random chance.

## Key Measures of Variability

- Range  
- Variance  
- Standard Deviation  
- Interquartile Range (IQR)  

## Self assessment (Key Measures of Variability)

**1. What is the primary advantage of using the range as a measure of variability?**

- [( )] A. It is robust to outliers.
- [( )] B. It considers all data points.
- [(X)] C. It is simple to calculate and understand.
- [( )] D. It provides information about the data's distribution shape.

---

**2. What does variance fundamentally measure?**

- [(X)] A. The spread of data points around the mean.
- [( )] B. The average distance between data points.
- [( )] C. The difference between the highest and lowest values.
- [( )] D. The central tendency of the data.

---

**3. How is standard deviation related to variance?**

- [( )] A. Standard deviation is the square of the variance.
- [(X)] B. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
- [( )] C. Standard deviation is half of the variance.
- [( )] D. Standard deviation is the reciprocal of the variance.

**4. The Interquartile Range (IQR) measures the spread of the:**

- [( )] A. Entire dataset.
- [(X)] B. Middle 50% of the data.
- [( )] C. Top 25% of the data.
- [( )] D. Bottom 25% of the data.


## Assumptions in Group Comparisons

  - *Checking tools:* Boxplots to compare variances, Levene's Test, Bartlett's Test  

- **Independence of Observations**  
  - *Checking tools:* Random sampling, No overlap between groups  

- **Sample Size Considerations**  
  - *Checking tools:* Power analysis, Sample size guidelines

## Key Elements in Test Output (Interpreting Results)

- **Test Statistic**  
  - A numerical value that summarizes the difference between groups.  

- **Degrees of Freedom**  
  - The number of independent pieces of information in the data used for estimating parameters.  

- **p-value**  
  - The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.  

- **Significance Level (usually Î± = 0.05)**  
  - The threshold for determining statistical significance; if p-value < Î±, reject the null hypothesis.  

- **Rejecting or Failing to Reject the Null Hypothesis**  
  - If p-value < Î±, reject Hâ‚€ (null hypothesis); otherwise, fail to reject Hâ‚€.  

- **Effect Size**  
  - A measure of the magnitude of the difference between groups, independent of sample size.

Hi, I am **Aditi**. I will help you to understand the concept of **parametric test**.

Parametric test is a statistical procedure that relies on assumptions regarding the distributional form of the underlying population â€” most commonly, that the population data follow a **normal distribution**.

These tests estimate population parameters (e.g., means, variances) and are generally applied to **interval** or **ratio-scale** data.

When their assumptions are met, **parametric tests are more statistically powerful** than their non-parametric counterparts, enabling more precise inference about population parameters.

</details>





## Parametric TestsÂ´ Data Set Criteria

- **Normal Distribution**  
  - Data should come from a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve).

- **Homogeneity of Variance**  
  - Groups should have similar variances (spread of data is similar).

- **Interval or Ratio Scale**  
  - Data should be measured on an interval or ratio scale (e.g., height, weight, income).


# T-tests

T-tests are used to **compare means between groups** to determine if differences are **statistically significant**.


 __When to Use:__

 - The **dependent variable** is **continuous**  
  - *(e.g., height, test scores)*  

- The **independent variable** is **categorical with up to two levels**  
  - *(Binary Grouping Variable, e.g., male vs. female)*

## Types of T-tests (contn.)

| Type                                  | Purpose                                              | Example |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **One-Sample T-test**                 | Compare the mean of one group to a known value.      | Test if average working hours differ from 40 hours.       |
| **Independent T-test (Two-Sample T-test)** | Compare means of two independent groups.        | Test if male and female students have different math scores. |
| **Paired T-test**                      | Compare means of two related groups (same individuals). | Test if an exercise program improves weightlifting performance before and after participation. |

# Practical Exercise

**Formulate and test a hypothesis using either an Independent T-test or Dependent T-test.**

- Based on your dataset, create a hypothesis suitable for either an **Independent or Dependent T-test**.  
- If necessary, modify the dataset to ensure it fits the hypothesis.  
  - Justify these changes logically in your hand-in document.  
- Perform the **T-test in R**, following the procedure discussed in class.  
- **Interpret the output and check the p-value.**  
- If the result is **significant**, explain why.  
- If **not significant**, explain why.
