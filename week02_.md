# Quantitative Research

{{0}}
> “Quantitative research is the methodology to quantify attitudes, opinions, behaviors and other defined variables, allowing researchers to generalize results from a larger sample population through the generation of numerical data.”  
> *(Mohajan, 2020, p. 50)*

# Quantitative Research Questions

## 1. Type of Quantitative Research Question
{{1}}

{{2}}
- __Comparative Questions:__ Do ITVET graduates in engineering programs earn higher starting salaries than those in hospitality programs?
{{3}}
- __Relationship-Based Questions:__ Is there a correlation between the duration of internships and employability of ITVET graduates?



## Practice: Categorize the following questions' type

{{0}}
**1. What is the average monthly stipend received by TVET students during internships?**

{{1}}

## 2. Identification of Variables

{{1}}
1. Independent Variables
2. Dependent Variables

{{2}}
**Example Research Question:**  
Does the number of hours of hands-on training (<span style="color:blue">independent variable</span>) influence the employability rate of TVET graduates (<span style="color:green">dependent variable</span>)?




## Practice: Identify variables


---

{{1}}
**Example 1:**  
In a study design comparing batterer treatment “dose”—either 16 weeks or 52 weeks—in relation to improvement in participants’ skill at peacefully resolving conflict with others, “dose” is the **[[independent]]** variable, and skill improvement is the **[[dependent]]** variable.

---

{{2}}
**Example 2:**  
In a study design assessing the risk of perpetrating sexual violence based on how high a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) has risen, perpetration risk is the **[[dependent]]** variable, and BAC is the **[[independent]]** variable.

---

{{3}}
**Example 3:**  
In a study design looking at social work students’ past experiences with family and friends who have intellectual disabilities and the students’ interest and comfort in working with the population of persons with intellectual disabilities:  
- Family experience is a **[[independent]]** variable,  
- Experience with friends is a **[[independent]]** variable,  
- Interest in this work is a **[[dependent]]** variable,  
- Comfort with this work is a **[[dependent]]** variable.

## 3. Aspects of Research Question  

1. Structure and Clarity
2. Relevance and Feasibility
3. Alignment with Research Design


## Research Question Comparison

| **Good Research Question** | **Bad Research Question** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Does the amount of time spent in hands-on training during a TVET program (independent variable) influence the job placement rate of graduates within six months of graduation (dependent variable)? | What are the effects of social media? |
| | Why do people like rock music? |

**<span style="color:blue">Task: Now convert the bad research questions to good research questions with the help of AI (any LLM).</span>**


# Task 1: From Topic to Research Question

**Time:** 15 minutes  

**Goal:** Practice narrowing a general interest area into a clear quantitative research question.


**Instructions:**


1. Choose one broad research topic from this list or create your own:

   - AI use & academic performance among ITVET students
   - Satisfaction with online learning platforms in vocational training
   - Student productivity in blended (online and in-person) session settings

2. Reframe the topic into one focused quantitative research question, following this structure:  

   *"What is the relationship between [independent variable] and [dependent variable] in [target population]?"*


# Literature Review 

{{1}}
“literature review provides background information, highlight the significance of the research being conducted, find the areas of controversy, identify gaps in existing knowledge, formulate new research questions or problems and inform the direction of future research”. (Hui, Kaur, Ray, Li, 2023, p-475)


{{2}}
The Essential Aspects of Literature Review

{{3}}
1. Purpose and Scope
2. Critical Evaluation
3. Theoretical Framework
4. Research Gap Identification
5. Methodological Considerations

# Task 2: Fast & Focused Literature Hunt

**Time:** 20 minutes  

**Goal:** Build awareness of the importance and feasibility of a literature review.


**Instructions:**


1. Find 2–3 peer-reviewed journal articles (Google Scholar, ResearchGate or library portal) related to the research question you formed.

2. For each article, create a reference in bibTeX notation with chatGPT:  

   - Title & author  
   - What variables were studied  
   - The population/sample used  
   - What kind of results or data they reported  


# Hypothesis Formulation 


{{1}}
According to Binoy (2019) & Supino (2012), Hypothesis formulation in quantitative research involves creating testable statements that predict relationships between variables, utilizing deductive reasoning. It serves as a guide for research direction, sample selection, and statistical analysis, ultimately facilitating the discussion of findings and conclusions. (Binoy, 2019) (Supino, 2012).

{{2}}
Aspects of Hypothesis Formulation 

{{3}}
1. Identify the type of Hypothesis
2. Variable Identification
3. Testability and Specificity
4. Alignment with Research Question


## Types of Hypothesis

{{1}}

1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**  

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)**  

   a. Directional (One-tailed)  

   b. Non-Directional (Two-tailed)

# Task 3: Hypothesis Challenge  

**Time:** 12 minutes  

**Goal:** Formulate testable hypotheses based on research questions.  

**Instructions:**  


1. Based on your research question and insights from literature, write:  

   - One null hypothesis **(H₀)** 
   - One alternative hypothesis **(H₁)**  

2. Be ready to explain:  

   - What kind of variables you're using (*continuous, categorical?*)  
   - Whether it's a correlation, comparison, or prediction
