# Quantitative Research Design

## Quantitative Research Design
**Definition:**  
"Research design refers to the approach for answering fundamental research questions. If it is quantitatively based, research design will center on numerical data collection and analysis."  
*(Grand Canyon University, 2023)*  

**Purpose:**  
- Quantify attitudes, opinions, behavior and other variables.  
- Generalize results from a larger sample population using numerical data. *(Mohajan, 2020)*

</div>

## a. Descriptive Research Design

| **Aspect**         | **Details** |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | Descriptive research design is a method that aims to systematically describe a population, situation, or phenomenon without manipulating any variables. It focuses on answering **"what," "when," "where," and "how"** questions. |
| **Characteristics** | - Does not control or manipulate variables.  \n - Provides detailed accounts of characteristics or behaviors.  \n - Primarily quantitative but can include qualitative data.  \n - Common methods include surveys, observations, and case studies.  \n - Focuses on data organization and summarization. |
| **Example**        | The **National Survey of Children‚Äôs Health (NSCH)** is an annual, cross-sectional survey that collects data on the physical and mental health of children aged 0-17 years in the United States. It gathers information on a wide range of topics, including:  \n - Demographic characteristics  \n - Health status  \n - Access to healthcare services  \n - Health behaviors  \n - Family & community context |


## b. Correlational Research Design

| **Aspect**         | **Details** |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | Correlational research design is a non-experimental methodology used to investigate the relationship between two or more variables without manipulating them. It identifies patterns and associations rather than establishing causality. |
| **Characteristics** | - Researchers observe and measure variables as they naturally occur without manipulation.  \n - Analysis relies on numerical data to assess relationships.  \n - Types of correlations can be **positive, negative, or nonexistent**. |
| **Example**        | A psychological correlational study might examine the relationship between **self-esteem and depression symptoms** among adolescents.  \n - By administering **self-report measures** of self-esteem and depression to a sample of teenagers and calculating the **correlation coefficient**, researchers can assess whether **lower self-esteem is associated with higher levels of depression symptoms**. |

## c. Experimental Research Design

| **Aspect**         | **Details** |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | Experimental research design is a systematic approach used to determine **causal relationships** between variables by manipulating one or more **independent variables** and observing the effects on **dependent variables**. |
| **Characteristics** | - Researchers **manipulate** the independent variable(s) to observe effects on the dependent variable(s).  \n - Includes a **control group** that does not receive the treatment.  \n - Participants are **randomly assigned** to groups to minimize bias.  \n - Focuses on **cause-and-effect relationships**. |
| **Example**        | In a **clinical trial**, researchers might test a **new medication** by randomly assigning participants to either:  \n - Receive the **medication**  \n - Receive a **placebo**  \n Then, they **measure health outcomes** to determine if the medication is effective compared to no treatment. |


## d. Quasi-experimental (Causal Comparative) Research Design

| **Aspect**         | **Details** |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | Quasi-experimental research design is a methodology used to study the effects of **independent variables** on **dependent variables** without **random assignment** of participants, often due to ethical or practical constraints. |
| **Characteristics** | - Participants are assigned to groups based on **non-random criteria**, leading to differences between groups.  \n - Researchers still **manipulate the independent variable** to observe its effect on the dependent variable.  \n - Conducted in **natural settings**, leading to **less internal validity** but enhancing **external validity**. |
| **Example**        | A **school** implements a **new reading program** in one class while another class continues with the **standard curriculum**.  \n - Researchers compare **reading scores** before and after the intervention to assess the program's effectiveness.  \n - Since students were **not randomly assigned** to classes, the study acknowledges **pre-existing differences** between groups. |


## Research Design Overview

| **Design**            | **When to Use**                                 | **Potential Tools**                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Descriptive**      | Describe sample                              | Mean, standard deviation         |
| **Experimental**     | Establish cause and effect                   | *T*-test, ANOVA                  |
| **Correlational**    | Describe relationship                        | Correlation, regression          |
| **Causal-Comparative** | Establish relationship after the fact       | *T*-test, ANOVA                  |




## 2. Control and Manipulation
In **experimental designs**, researchers **control and manipulate** variables to establish **cause-and-effect relationships**.

This involves:  

1. Identifying **independent** and **dependent** variables.  
   
2. Ensuring that **extraneous variables** are controlled.  

---

## 3. Validity and Reliability
Ensuring the study's **validity** (*accuracy of the results*) and **reliability** (*consistency of the results*) is crucial.

This involves:  

1. Careful planning of the **research process**.  
   
2. Selecting appropriate **data collection and analysis methods**.

# Sampling Methods

## Concept of Sampling

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    Sampling in quantitative research is the process of selecting a representative subset from a population to analyze characteristics. It ensures that the sample reflects the population, allowing researchers to draw valid conclusions about the broader group being studied (Rahman, 2022).

## Types of Sampling Procedure


<div style="text-align: center;">     
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OVGU-VET-TechEd/Quantitative_Methods_with_R/6bc252fc7076bd103041fcf06cd178de93c43a75/Media_week3/Picture4.jpg" alt="Sampling Methods" width="60%">  
</div>


## 1. Probability Sampling

<div style="font-size: 0.9em; max-width: 95%; margin: 0 auto;">
| **Type**                 | **Definition** | **Advantages** | **Shortcomings** | **Example** |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Simple Random Sampling** | Each population member has an equal chance of selection. | - Highly representative. <br> - Easy to understand. | - Needs full population list. <br> - Time-consuming for large groups. | Randomly selecting 50 students from a university using a lottery system. |
| **Stratified Sampling** | The population is split into strata and random samples are drawn from each. | - Represents all subgroups. <br> - Boosts result precision. | - Requires detailed population data. <br> - More complex than random sampling. | Dividing a population into male and female groups, then randomly selecting 25 individuals from each. |
| **Cluster Sampling** | The population is divided into clusters and entire clusters are randomly selected. | - Cost-effective for large or geographically dispersed populations. <br> - Simplifies data collection. | - Higher sampling error risk if clusters are not representative. <br> - Clusters may have similar characteristics. | Randomly selecting 10 schools in a district and surveying all students in those schools. |
| **Systematic Sampling** | Every nth member of the population is selected after a random starting point. | - Simpler and quicker than random sampling. <br> - Useful for ordered lists. | - May introduce bias if the list has a hidden pattern. | Surveying every 10th person on a list of employees after selecting a random starting point. |
</div>


## 2. Non-Probability Sampling

<div style="font-size: 0.9em; max-width: 95%; margin: 0 auto;">
| **Type**                         | **Definition** | **Advantages** | **Shortcomings** | **Example** |
|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Convenience Sampling** | Selecting individuals who are easiest to reach. | - Quick and inexpensive. <br> - Useful for exploratory research. | - Highly prone to bias and unrepresentative results. <br> - Limited generalizability. | Surveying people in a shopping mall because they are readily available. |
| **Judgmental (Purposive) Sampling** | Selecting individuals based on specific characteristics or criteria determined by the researcher. | - Focused on relevant individuals for the study. <br> - Useful for niche or expert populations. | - Subjective and prone to researcher bias. <br> - Difficult to generalize findings. | Interviewing climate scientists to study opinions on global warming. |
| **Quota Sampling** | Ensuring that specific subgroups are represented in the sample in proportions matching the population. | - Ensures representation of key subgroups. <br> - Easier and quicker than stratified sampling. | - Subject to researcher bias during selection. <br> - Does not guarantee randomness. | Ensuring a sample of 100 includes 50 males and 50 females from a community. |
| **Snowball Sampling** | Existing participants recruit future participants from among their acquaintances. | - Effective for reaching hard-to-access populations (e.g., marginalized groups). <br> - Builds trust through referrals. | - Can lead to biased samples as participants often recruit similar individuals. <br> - Limited control over sample composition. | Asking one drug user to refer other drug users for a study on substance abuse. |
