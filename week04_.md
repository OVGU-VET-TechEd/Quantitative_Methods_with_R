## Questionnaire vs Survey

| Questionnaire | Survey |
|---------------|--------|
| A questionnaire is a list of questions prepared as part of a survey | A survey is a process that includes preparing a questionnaire, distributing it, gathering data and analyzing it |
| Often designed for the purpose of a survey/statistical study | It is often used in analyzing and studying something in an attempt to understand it better |

## Steps to Design & Execute a Questionnaire (contn.)

__1. ____**Set the Goal of the Questionnaire**__

* Statistical analyses required for the study
* Data required to do the analyses
* Consider the type of information to be conveyed

__2.__ __**Clarity and Simplicity**__

| Bad Example | Good Example |
|-------------|--------------|
| "Regarding your utilization of web-based social networking platforms, do you find that the affordances provided facilitate the development of parasocial relationships with content creators, and if so, to what extent does this impact your self-esteem?" | "When you use social media sites like Facebook or Instagram, do you feel like you get to know the people you follow?" |

__3.__ **Avoiding Bias**

| Vague quantifiers | •How often do you visit the library? |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Suggestive questions | •Wouldn't you agree that the library's new opening hours are inconvenient? |
| Negations (especially double negatives) | •Do you disagree that libraries should not charge late fees? |
| Double barrelled questions | •How satisfied are you with the library's book selection and online resources? |
| Jargon and slang | •How fire are the library's new databases? |
| Questions that respondents cannot answer | •How many books did you borrow from the library in 2021? |

# Ethical Considerations & Handling Missing Data

<!-- No content for this slide -->

## Ethical Considerations

* **Informed Consent**
* **Privacy and Confidentiality**
* **Transparency and Accountability**
* **Right to Withdraw**
* **Maximizing Response Rates**
* **Targeted Distribution**
* **Follow-up Reminders**

## Handling Missing Data

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OVGU-VET-TechEd/Quantitative_Methods_with_R/508900223b402eb976ebe59c45903f2f2327d28d/Media_week4/Picture9.jpg" alt="Visualization of Missing Data Handling" width="600"/>


## Handling Missing Data (contn.)

* **Understanding Missing Data**

| Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) | • Missingness is unrelated to any data; complete case analysis yields unbiased results |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing at Random (MAR) | • Missingness related to observed data; multiple imputation can provide valid estimates |
| Missing Not at Random (MNAR) | • Missingness related to unobserved data; requires specialized methods or sensitivity analyses |

## Handling Missing Data (contn.)

* **Imputation Methods**

1. Simple Imputation (Mean, Median, Mode)
2. Regression Imputation (Predictive Modelling)
3. Multiple Imputation (Generate Multiple Datasets)

## Handling Missing Data (contn.)

* **Deletion Methods**

| Deletion Method | Sample Size Impact | Bias Potential |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Listwise Deletion** | High reduction | High |
| **Pairwise Deletion** | Moderate reduction | Moderate |

## Practical Exercise

* Create a questionnaire based on your research question and design.
* Use one of the tools provided in the slide.
* Once finished, test it and download the data as csv (preferred) or xlsx data for further exploration in R.
* If it aligns with your research question, search for standardized questionnaire and use it.
